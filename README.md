# Interview Questions #

This is a simple project that holds a set of classes named ProblemOne, ProblemTwo, ProblemThree, etc.
These are partially implemented classes that have comments in them that explain what to do to 
complete the problems correctly.

This project is used to test prospective developers on basic Java programming skills. Since it is a
standard Maven project, it can be loaded into any IDE that supports Maven and has Internet, as it will
need to download dependencies from Maven Central.

Prospective employees should be given a clone of this project and asked to answer as many of the
problems as is deemed necessary to gauge the programmer's skill. The problems are as follows:

# Version 1 Test
* ProblemOne - implement three methods that add up numbers in an array with a for loop, a while loop, 
  and recursion, respectively.
  
* ProblemTwo - Given the commons-io Javadoc page and the java.io Javadoc page in a browser, write
  some code that counts the # of files in a dir, lists the file names, and prints the content of 
  one of the files.
  
* ProblemThree - Given an existing JDBC program that uses a Statement to query from a table, modify
  the program to use a properly parameterized PreparedStatement instead, and also modify the program
  to correct any errors that may exist in the proper closing of resources.
  
* ProblemFour - Given and existing partial implementation, implement the analyze method. The analyze
  method takes an arbitrary string (preferably of English words) and produces a Map that contains a
  mapping of individual characters to the frequencies of those characters in the supplied string. The
  detailed rules for the parser are in the Javadoc comments for the ProblemFour class.
